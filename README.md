<p>This is a Data Structure Project using Java language.</p>
<p>For this project the type of Data Structure used are Linked List and Array List for storing the menu and the orders a client can do.</p>
<p>From the CMD using Switch case the customer first can choose from:</p>
<p>1. Displaying Menu</p>
<p>2. Making Order</p>
<p>3. Show Order</p>
<p>4. EXIT Program</p>
<p>If the customer chooses 1, the menu will be displayed on the screen, which is read from the menu.csv with the products.</p>
<p>After the customer sees the products with these attributes: id, name, category, price, quantity.</p>
<p>Then he can click 2 to make orders by selecting from ID.</p>
<p>For each product, the cost will be calculated based on the quantity and the total cost so far, as the customer can choose more products from the menu.</p>
<p>The customer could also remove a product by pressing -1 and selecting from the product id to remove it, the total price will be updated and the quantity too.</p>
<p>If the customer wants to finish the order, press 0 and the order will be finished. Also, if another customer comes to make an order, the quantity will be updated.</p>
<p>All the orders will be saved in orders.csv where it will save Customer name, product, quantity, and total price.</p>
